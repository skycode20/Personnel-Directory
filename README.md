  ## Description    

  The Personnel Tracker is an application in which the user can search a list of employees with ease. Imagine a manager that desired an seamless view of their employees easily searchable based on the criteria entered into the input field. It works very quickly which is important for any manager with very little time to be able to search the list of employees and find the personnel they're looking for.

  In the future I would like to connect this application to a database so organizations could enter their personnel in the system and have the application populate it on screen. This would be nice as a standalone app that could be compatoble with mobile phones, tablets, and the desktop. I would also like to expand the functionality by adding delete and update functions to the application to fulfill more fucntions than just searching for personnel.

  ## Installation    

  Installation is not necessary. The application is a React application deployed on the Heroku framework.

  ## Usage    

  Start the application. The application will auto-populate a list of 80 personnel. The user can scroll down to view the list manually or could search the list of personnel by using the `search bar`. By entering in letters inside of the input field, the names of the list will start to narrow based on the criteria searched for. It is very straightforward and easy to use.
